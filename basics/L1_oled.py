# L1_oled program for Raspberry Pi, used in lab 2 exercises. Does not display SSID, for simplicity
# Runs the SSD1306 with I2C and displays a title and IP address that is updated every second
# Before running, make sure to stop the default OLED service with the terminal command: 
#            sudo systemctl stop oled.service

# To restart the default OLED service, run the terminal command: 
#            sudo systemctl restart oled.service

# NOTE!!!
# This code is intended for reference and to demonstrate the the functionality of the OLED display.
# The code temporarily displays on the OLED while it is running and stops displaying when the script
# is terminated. It is not intended to, and should not, replace the oled.py service file for continously
# displaying to the OLED from boot. Please reference and use the oled.py file for this use case.

## Functions to get readings for IP and voltage ##

# Get a voltage reading from the INA219
def getVoltage():
    ##########################################
    # Task: Write your own code here to read and return the voltage reading from L1_ina
    #       You must import the necessary python file in order to do this.
    #       Try giving the import an alias similarily done in line 17 above.
    #       This makes it convenient in referencing the import for use.
    
    #       The general format for retrieving the return of a function from another file is:
    #       variable_name = filename_or_alias.function_name()
    #       You can reference lines 31 through 33 as some examples.
    
    #       You should be able to accomplish this task with one line of code.
    ##########################################
    vred = ina.readVolts()
    return vred # Be sure to return your variable name for your getVoltage()

# This function will try to find an IPv4 address from eth0 (ethernet) or wlan0 (wireless), in that order
def getIp():
    for interface in ni.interfaces()[1:]:   #For interfaces eth0 and wlan0
    
        try:
            ip = ni.ifaddresses(interface)[ni.AF_INET][0]['addr']
            return ip
            
        except KeyError:                    #We get a KeyError if the interface does not have the info
            continue                        #Try the next interface since this one has no IPv4
        
    return 'No network found'                        #No interfaces had IPv4, so there's no network available
